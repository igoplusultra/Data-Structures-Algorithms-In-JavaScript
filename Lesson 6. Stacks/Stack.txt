Stack -  linear data structure that follows LIFO, or (Last in, First Out) principle

Stack Example.
                                 Lets say we have list of books
book 1, 
book 2,
book 3,
book 4

When then want to stack each of our books in a bookshelf with one on top of the other

book 4,
book 3,
book 2,
book 1

If we then wanted to get the first book back we would have to take all the books on top of book 1 to get it

            book 4, ---> took book 4 off the bookshelf
            book 3, ----> took book 3 off the bookshelf
            book 2, ----- > took book 2 off the bookshelf
book 1 ---> found book one

book 1 is considered the last in because after taking all the books off of it, it is the last book in the stack

book 4 is considered the first out because it's the first book to be popped off the stack


Just liked linked list stack nodes  contain a reference and a value         

First Out ---> 4
                            3
                            2
Last In ---->    1
