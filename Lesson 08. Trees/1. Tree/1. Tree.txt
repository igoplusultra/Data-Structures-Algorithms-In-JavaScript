Tree - is a fundamental hierarchical or  branching data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected by edges(links), and form a tree like structure

Tree Example.

                                 1 <- PARENT/ROOT
                                ↙️   ↘️
CHILD/SIB -> 2              5 <- CHILD/SIB 


Keep something in mind if the nodes that come after the root/parent don't have any children nodes then we call those nodes leaf nodes


                                 1 
                                ↙️   ↘️
                           2            5 
                          ↙️                 ↘️
                    LEAF                LEAF

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Full Tree - Each node either has no children (leaf node) or exactly two children

Full Tree Example.

                                   1 
                                ↙️       ↘️
                           2                 5 
                          ↙️  ↘️     LEAF NODE
                        3      4
                    TWO CHILDREN

Perfect Tree 

Full + Balance

Balance - All the leaf nodes are at the same depth(distance) from the root. Meaning the tree is completely filled with no gaps at any level.

Perfect Tree Example.

                                   1 
                                ↙️       ↘️
                           6                 5 


Not a Perfect Tree Example.

                                     1 
                                ↙️       ↘️
                           6                 5 
                        ↙️
                    7  

This is not a Perfect Tree because not all the leaf nodes are the same distance from the root, because it takes the 7 node 2 nodes to get back to the root, while it takes the 5 node 1 node to get back to the parent, and the 6 node is no longer a leaf node because it has a child node, so remember a node is only a leaf node if it has no children

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete Tree 

Almost Full Levels - All levels except possibly the last one are completely filled with nodes

Left Leaning Last Level - The last level is filled with nodes from the left side a much as possible, but there might be empty spaces on the right

Complete Tree Example.

                                    1 
                                ↙️      ↘️
                           6                 5 
                         ↙️ ↘️              ↙️   ↘️
                        7   8             3    1                
                     ↙️ ↘️  ↙️↘️         ↙️ ↘️  ↙️↘️
                    5  2  1  2       4 5  8 7

This is not a Perfect Tree because not all the leaf nodes are the same distance from the root, because it takes the 7 node 2 nodes to get back to the root, while it takes the 5 node 1 node to get back to the parent, and the 6 node is no longer a leaf node because it has a child node, so remember a node is only a leaf node if it has no children
