Binary Search Tree - a special kind of  tree used to organize data in a sorted way. It works like a filing cabinet where you can efficiently search, add, or remove items

Binary Search Tree Example.

Go left if your value is smaller than the current branch
Go right if your value is bigger than the current branch


                                   5  root
                             ↙️            ↘️
                           3                 8 
                         ↙️               ↙️   ↘️
                      1               7        9            

So basically the question we are asking is my new node greater or less than the current branch, lets go through each iteration of our example to see the process

1. node 3 > root node 5 ? NO -> move node 3 to the Left

                                   5  root
                             ↙️           
                        3

2. node 1 > root node 5 ? NO ->  move node 1 to the left \ 
            node 1 > node 3 ? NO ->  move node 1 to the left

                                5  root
                             ↙️           
                        3
                    ↙️     
                1

3. node 8 > root node 5 ? YES -> move node 8 to the right 

                                5  root
                             ↙️        ↘️
                        3                8
                    ↙️     
                1

4. node 7 > root node 5 ? YES -> move node 7 to the right
            node 7 > node 8 ? NO -> move node 7 to the left

                                5  root
                             ↙️        ↘️
                        3                8
                    ↙️                  ↙️ 
                1                    7

5. node 9 > root node 5 ? YES -> move node 9 to the right
            node 9 > node 8 ? YES -> move node 9
             to the right

                                5  root
                             ↙️        ↘️
                        3                8
                    ↙️                  ↙️  ↘️
                1                    7       9
