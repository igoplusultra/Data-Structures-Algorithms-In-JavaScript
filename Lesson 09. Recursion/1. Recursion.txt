Recursion - the process when a function calls itself. But it doesn't call itself exactly the same way each time

Recursion Example.

    Russian nesting dolls:

Initially the doll will be wrapped in a box ðŸ“¦

And once we open that box we have a doll

ðŸŽŽ 

Which then allows us to open that doll, and we have another doll

  ðŸŽŽ          ðŸŽŽ    

Then again 

    ðŸŽŽ          ðŸŽŽ          ðŸŽŽ 

Then finally again

ðŸŽŽ          ðŸŽŽ          ðŸŽŽ          ðŸŽŽ

How does Recursion play a roll in this process ?

The function makes the problem smaller by changing the input a bit. Like finding a smaller doll inside a bigger one.

We have the ability to provide the point to stop execution once our function has met a certain condition, this is called the base case. (The Smallest Doll)

As long as it's not the base case, the function calls itself with the smaller problem
